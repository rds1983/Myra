![NonModalWindows Sample](~/images/samples/NonModalWindows.png)

Demonstrates the creation and management of multiple non-modal windows that don't block interaction with other UI elements.

### AssetManagement
[View on GitHub](https://github.com/MyraUI/Myra/tree/master/samples/Myra.Samples.AssetManagement)

![AssetManagement Sample](~/images/samples/AssetManagement.png)

Demonstrates how to manage and load assets (textures, fonts) within Myra applications.

### ObjectEditor
[View on GitHub](https://github.com/MyraUI/Myra/tree/master/samples/Myra.Samples.ObjectEditor)

![ObjectEditor Sample](~/images/samples/ObjectEditor.png)

Shows how to create a property editor UI for editing object properties, useful for tools and debugging utilities.

### Notepad
[View on GitHub](https://github.com/MyraUI/Myra/tree/master/samples/Myra.Samples.Notepad)

![Notepad Sample](~/images/samples/Notepad.png)

A practical example of building a text editor application with file operations, including open, save, and edit functionality.

### Viewports
[View on GitHub](https://github.com/MyraUI/Myra/tree/master/samples/Myra.Samples.Viewports)

![Viewports Sample](~/images/samples/Viewports.png)

Demonstrates the use of viewport-based rendering for displaying content in constrained areas of the UI.

### Arrow
[View on GitHub](https://github.com/MyraUI/Myra/tree/master/samples/Myra.Samples.CustomWidgets.Arrow)

![Arrow Sample](~/images/samples/CustomWidgets.Arrow.png)

This sample implements a custom `Arrow` widget that draws arrows (left or right direction) using the RenderContext's `DrawLine` and `DrawPolygon` methods.

### LogView
[View on GitHub](https://github.com/MyraUI/Myra/tree/master/samples/Myra.Samples.CustomWidgets.LogView)

![LogView Sample](~/images/samples/CustomWidgets.LogView.png)

This sample implements a `LogView` widget that extends `ScrollViewer` and contains a `VerticalStackPanel` filled with `Label` widgets. It shows how to compose custom widgets from existing built-in widgets and manage dynamic content with scrolling and animation.

### Scene3D
[View on GitHub](https://github.com/MyraUI/Myra/tree/master/samples/Myra.Samples.CustomWidgets.Scene3D)

![Scene3D Sample](~/images/samples/CustomWidgets.Scene3D.png)

This sample implements a `Scene3D` widget that performs 3D rendering using XNA Framework's `BasicEffect`. It handles mesh rendering, lighting, texture mapping, and manages 3D graphics state within the widget's render context, allowing seamless integration of 3D content into the Myra UI.

### SkiaSharp
[View on GitHub](https://github.com/MyraUI/Myra/tree/master/samples/Myra.Samples.CustomWidgets.SkiaSharp)

![SkiaSharp Sample](~/images/samples/CustomWidgets.SkiaSharp.png)

This sample demonstrates integrating SkiaSharp with Myra to create a custom widget that renders SkiaSharp 2D graphics within the Myra UI framework. The `SKCanvasWidget` bridges SkiaSharp's powerful vector graphics capabilities with Myra's widget system, allowing developers to use SkiaSharp's drawing API (circles, text, paths, etc.) to render content inside Myra widgets. The sample shows a split-pane layout with a SkiaSharp-rendered canvas alongside a text box, illustrating how third-party graphics libraries can be seamlessly integrated into Myra applications.

### PlatformAgnostic Family

The PlatformAgnostic samples demonstrate how to use Myra.PlatformAgnostic, a cross-platform graphics abstraction layer. Multiple backend implementations are provided to show integration with different graphics frameworks.

#### PlatformAgnostic.MonoGame
[View on GitHub](https://github.com/MyraUI/Myra/tree/master/samples/Myra.Samples.PlatformAgnostic.MonoGame)

Demonstrates using Myra.PlatformAgnostic with MonoGame Framework, enabling cross-platform desktop graphics with a familiar game development API.

#### PlatformAgnostic.Raylib
[View on GitHub](https://github.com/MyraUI/Myra/tree/master/samples/Myra.Samples.PlatformAgnostic.Raylib)

Demonstrates using Myra.PlatformAgnostic with Raylib, a lightweight and cross-platform graphics library that simplifies low-level graphics programming.

#### PlatformAgnostic.OpenTK
[View on GitHub](https://github.com/MyraUI/Myra/tree/master/samples/Myra.Samples.PlatformAgnostic.OpenTK)

Demonstrates using Myra.PlatformAgnostic with OpenTK, a C# binding for OpenGL providing direct and efficient access to graphics APIs.

#### PlatformAgnostic.Silk.NET
[View on GitHub](https://github.com/MyraUI/Myra/tree/master/samples/Myra.Samples.PlatformAgnostic.Silk.NET)

Demonstrates using Myra.PlatformAgnostic with Silk.NET, a modern OpenGL/Vulkan binding for .NET, providing low-level control and cross-platform graphics capabilities.

#### PlatformAgnostic.Silk.NET.TrippyGL
[View on GitHub](https://github.com/MyraUI/Myra/tree/master/samples/Myra.Samples.PlatformAgnostic.Silk.NET.TrippyGL)

An advanced example using Silk.NET with TrippyGL for specialized graphics rendering effects and advanced 3D techniques.
