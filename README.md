Myra is UI Library for [MonoGame](http://www.monogame.net/), [FNA](https://github.com/FNA-XNA/FNA) and [Stride](https://github.com/stride3d/stride).  

## Features
* **Rich Set of Widgets.** Myra has following widgets: Button, CheckBox, ComboBox, ListBox, TabControl, Grid, Image, Menu, ProgressBar, ScrollPane, SplitPane(with arbitrary number of splitters), Slider, TextBlock, TextField, SpinButton, Tree, Window, Dialog, FileDialog, ColorPickerDialog and PropertyGrid.
* **MML(Myra Markup Language).** XML based declarative language to describe UI ([example](/samples/Myra.Samples.AllWidgets/allControls.xml)).
* **Skinning.**  The default skin(it had been borrowed from [VisUI](https://github.com/kotcrab/vis-ui)) could be replaced with a custom skin loaded from the XML ([example](/samples/Myra.Samples.CustomUIStylesheet/Resources/ui_stylesheet.xml)).
